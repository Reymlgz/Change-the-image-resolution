# Resizer: A Script for Changing Image Resolution

Resizer is a simple yet powerful Python script that enables you to resize multiple images at once. 
Whether you need to downscale or upscale your images, Resizer is here to help you save time and effort.

# Getting Started

Before you can use Resizer, you need to install the Pillow library. You can do this by typing the following command in your terminal:

  `pip install pillow`

Once Pillow is installed, you can run Resizer by typing the following command in your terminal:

  `python resize.py` 
  
# How to Use Resizer
Follow these steps to use Resizer:

 - Place the images you want to resize in the `images` folder.

 - Open the resize.py file in a text editor or IDE of your choice.

 - Edit the `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` variables to the desired resolution.

 - By default, Resizer looks for images in the folder `images` and saves the resized images in the folder named `images-with-new-resolution`.

 - Save your changes and run the script using the command `python resize.py`.

 - Resizer will automatically resize all the images so now you can check in the `images-with-new-resolution` folder.

And that's it! Resizer is an easy-to-use tool that can help you resize images in no time. Happy resizing!
